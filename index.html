                            I am from Siklós, living with my parents and little
                            brother, Márk. We're lucky to have grandma and
                            grandpa just down the street. Family means
                            everything to me, and I cherish every moment spent
                            with them.

                            Hey there, I'm a 13-year-old girl, and swimming is
                            my world. When the final school bell rings, you can
                            bet I'm heading straight to the pool. The water is
                            like a second home, and every stroke feels like pure
                            freedom. Swimming isn't just a hobby for me; it's a
                            burning passion. It's where I leave my worries
                            behind, and I strive to be the best. Dreaming of
                            standing on that podium keeps me going, and I'll
                            stop at nothing to get there. So, watch out world,
                            because this 13-year-old swimmer is on a mission to
                            make waves!

                            I am all about adventure. When I'm not at the pool,
                            I'm out on my bike, exploring new paths and feeling
                            the wind in my hair. I also adore reading romantic
                            books, getting lost in love stories that make my
                            heart skip a beat. But what truly lights up my day
                            is playing with my little brother, Márk. We share
                            giggles, secrets, and endless fun. And when my
                            cousin Alex comes over, our trio becomes a squad of
                            unstoppable joy. Life's a beautiful journey filled
                            with family, books, biking, and the magic of being
                            13.
